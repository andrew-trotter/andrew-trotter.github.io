        <h3>What are they?</h3>
        <p>I was in my early 20's and had somewhat recently completed a course in first aid and had been walking in town with a friend and witnessed an accident between a motorbike and a car. There were pieces all over the road, people starting to get over and help out. With my knowledge of first aid I wanted to help to so I started heading over to do what I could. It dawned on me that I couldn't recall how to do first aid and I wasn't confident I could do it well. I felt torn as I had this certificate but not the ability to do it. What if he had a neck injury and I moved him improperly. I was worried I might be the only one with the knowledge and that I couldn't do it. Thankfully it looked like people were already tending motorcyclist so I felt okay just moving the debris off the road to help motorists and headed off.</p>
        <p>I had to weigh up whether I would do more harm than good, whether I trusted my ability when in the moment. I still wanted to help, but I didn't want to do harm. In reality I didn't trust myself enough with handling the person, but did what I could manage in the surrounding area.</p>
        <p>I look back and think it was the right decision given what was happening. He was being handled, I wasn't confident and in the end I did what I could. I think it's a shame that despite completing the first aid course I still didn't feel competent in the situation.</p>
