          <h3>What are they?</h3>
          <p>They are two types of selectors used in CSS to apply styling rules to elements in HTML. 
            There are more selectors, and together they help to provide design consistency throughout
            a website.</p>            
            <h3>Specificity</h3>
            <p>Just briefly, Specificity is a scoring system used to determine the hierarchy of which CSS rules are determined 
              when targeting the same HTML tag. By default, higher rules will be overridden by rules declared lower down 
              unless a rule with a higher specificity is declared. </p>
              <p>The hierarchy stands as follows: <br>
              Important! > inline > <span id="text-red">id</span> > <span class="text-blue">class</span> > element</p>
              <p>So between Class and ID, ID is a higher priority when CSS rules are being selected.</p>
        </section>        
        <section class="blog-box">
          <h3>What is a Class?</h3>
          <p>The class selector identifies all elements with the same class name attribute and applies CSS rules to them. 
            Widely used on divs to make this container tag more specific, but very commonly used on most elements too.</p>
            HTML: <pre><code>&lt;p <strong>class=&quot;text-blue&quot;</strong>&gt; I'm a red because I used the ID &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><br>
              CSS: <pre><code>.text-blue{color: blue;}</code></pre>
              <p class="text-blue">I'm a blue instead of white because I used the class selector</p>
        </section>
        <section class="blog-box">
          <h3>What is an ID?</h3>
          <p>An ID is a selector that is used by developers to target or identify a specific element. In fact, each element can only 
            have one ID. If an element is given two ID's, it won't respect any ID ruling. ID's are noted 
            This is useful because you can apply styling to just one element and it won't be affected by other class declarations. </p>
            HTML: <pre><code>&lt;p class=&quot;text-blue&quot; <strong>id=&quot;text-red&quot;</strong>&gt; I'm a red because I used the ID &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><br>
            CSS: <pre>#blog-box-red {background-color: red;}</pre>
            <p class="text-blue" id="text-red">I'm a red because I used the ID</p>
        </section>
        <section class="blog-box">
          <h3>What's the difference?</h3>
          <p> Consider it like this. A school is your HTML page, <span class="text-blue">classrooms</span> in a school are your classes, and the <span id="text-red">names</span> of 
              children or staff in each classroom are the IDs. The class <span class="text-blue">Room 4</span> has an allocated time in the gym before it's <span class="text-blue">Room 5's</span> turn.
              But a student, <span id="text-red">Tim Buckland</span>, is needed in the Principal's office. The <span class="text-blue">class</span> goes to the gym, but <span id="text-red">Tim</span> goes to the principal's 
              office because he specifically has been called, so it overrides his need to go to the gym. A <span class="text-blue">class</span> identifies a selection 
              of elements with the class name and an ID is specific and identifies one element.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="blog-box">
          <h3>In Summary</h3>
          <p>
            It is best practice to use an ID once per page to preserve it's use and identify elements specifically. 
            If more than one element must be selected, take advantage of the cascading nature of CSS and declare a 
            class underneath other classes.</p>
            <p><em>It should be noted that an ID can be used more than once on a page, despite my research indicating it couldn't.</em>
