        <h2>Blocked on a simple problem</h2>
        <p>I had this function for a cafe app where I wanted it to do one of three options. Either it deducts the ordered food from the inventory, it indicates that there's only one left by turning the text red, or apologises for when there is none left. It would deduct the inventory, turn the text red and apologise, but never made the inventory become zero. <br>
        To figure out what was going on, I made it tell me what option it was choosing. Turns out all options were being chosen, but I hadn't allowed the stock to deduct when it was one or less.</p>

        <div class="blog-box blog-box-text">
            <h2>Elegantly solved a problem</h2>
            <p>I was feeling inspired and wanted to add some features to the cafe app. I didn't like how repeats of the same item appeared multiple times, so I wanted make it so it listed  "3 x muffins" and "2 x sandwiches". <br>
            What I did was take the list, look through it and count each item in the list. Once counted, I ran that output into my englishify method to make it say "muffins" instead of "muffin" and tah dah!

          <p>At first it required a lot of getting the logging, googling and trialling stuff to get it going. It was pretty frustrating when I thought I understood something and I didn't get the result that I expected, but I realised the more frustrated I got the more exhausting the process became. So I switched gears, took a break and really tried to think through exactly what I needed. Talking out loud helped writing out the psuedocode helped me clarify what needed to happen. Things like "I have this and I can use these methods. So, do this, then I need to do such and such".</p>

          <h2>Confidence in problem-solving techniques/processes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode: 6/10 
            <p>I'm good at writing this when I do, but generally I have an idea of how I'm going to make the function and then get into it. I will start writing this at first regardless, especially when it's more than simple and I have a parameter that's a collection like an array or object.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Trying something: 10/10 
            <p>I'm pretty good at just trying stuff. Like with objects, it can be tricky to remember the exact way to access a key or value you want and there are different ways to go through objects. I think the problem I find is it means my understanding is low, so I'm spitballing things I think work. So if this method doesn't work, I need to switch to something else.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method: 7/10 
            <p>This one is great when I'm really stuck and need to slow my thinking to more step-by-step. I don't have a physical object to talk to, but I'll talk aloud. I'm on the hunt for maybe a little Master Chief to have on my desk.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Reading error messages: 7/10 
            <p>I have the console open always and constantly saving and seeing how things are changing. So I've become pretty good at reading error messages.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Console.logging: 10/10 
            <p>This is my bread and butter for understanding what's happening to something as it goes through my functions, especially branching things like if statements or when it's run through a for-loop.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Googling: 9/10 
            <p>Forever googling! There are so many ways to approach a problem and so many methods it's hard to remember them all. I'm constantly on MDN looking at methods for different data types and structures.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Asking your peers for help: 6/10 
            <p>I haven't needed to ask for help from my peers much. I know there's a lot I can learn with CSS and some peers are better, so I asked a peer for what resources they used for CSS structuring which was helpful. Gave me an opportunity to extend a hand if they need help in the future which was cool </p>
            </li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help: 6/10 
            <p>I haven't gotten so stuck that I've needed to approach staff for help much. I asked for advice about a good way to approach something with CSS so I'm not unable to ask for help.</p>  
            </li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection: 6/10 
            <p>It's difficult to take a step back after working through a problem because I want to crack on with the next thing. But writing this blog and reviewing each technique, has allowed me to reflect on my process. I'd rate it low for myself because I struggle to allow myself time to step back and reflect, but having done the reflection, I'd say I'm fairly good at the act of reflecting.</p>

          <h2>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h2>
          <p>Asking for help isn't something that comes easily to me. I recall working in the kitchen at McDonald's during a very busy, understaffed shift and I was getting overwhelmed. I wasn't sure if I should ask for help. Everything's on fire, everyone's busy and it would mean that I'm not doing good enough and letting the team down. I stayed quiet and kept plugging along. What I didn't realise was front counter was catching up and the manager could be available to help and keep up the flow. In the end, because I didn't ask for help, people waited longer for food, we operated slower as a team and because I didn't want to let the team down by asking for help, I let them down anyway.</p>
