        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p><q>The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.</q> - Salovey and Mayer 1990 </p>
        <p>The scope of Emotional Intelligence is captured well by Salovey and Mayer. It's our ability to observe, identify and reason with ours and other's emotions. The order of growth for emotional intelligence follows that order also. Observation and identification of our own emotions. The ability to reason with them, and then extending that to others. We can only know others by knowing ourselves which is where empathy begins. Empathy, which is the ability to understand and share the emotional perspective of other people, comes from recognising how your self would be in their self's position.</p>
        <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>You could consider IQ the discipline of ideas and EQ the discipline of people.</p>
        <p>IQ is the measure for general intelligence or cognitive ability. I see IQ as the ability to acquire, explore and implement information. People that are intelligent can be observed being good at problem-solving, logical reasoning,learning and retaining information, maths and creativity. </p>
        <p>Some examples of what emotionally intelligent people that would be:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Self-aware: Being aware of their own emotions and able to regulate them during difficult situations</li>
            <li>Empathetic: Being able to understand and share the emotional perspective of other people</li>
            <li>Effective communicators: Being able to communicate their perspective and listen to others</li>
          </ul> 
          <p>So if IQ is the ability to acquire and manipulate information then EQ is the ability to identify and manipulate emotions.</p>
        <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
        <p>When there are people, there are emotions. Knowing what you and others are feeling or could feel allows you to better understand the situation and act advantageously whether personal or professional. By having more knowledge, you can make better decisions for yourself and others. It helps you recognise unhealthy behaviours in yourself and others, making it possible to improve those situations, whether that's correcting your own behaviour or addressing the other person's behaviour. By communicating well with others, it helps to form good relationships with them which leads to success.</p>
