        <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
        <p>I was in my early 20's and had somewhat recently completed a course in first aid and had been walking in town with a friend and witnessed an accident between a motorbike and a car. There were pieces all over the road, people starting to get over and help out. With my knowledge of first aid I wanted to help to so I started heading over to do what I could. It dawned on me that I couldn't recall how to do first aid and I wasn't confident I could do it well. I felt torn as I had this certificate but not the ability to do it. What if he had a neck injury and I moved him improperly. I was worried I might be the only one with the knowledge and that I couldn't do it. Thankfully it looked like people were already tending motorcyclist so I felt okay just moving the debris off the road to help motorists and headed off.</p>
        <p>I had to weigh up whether I would do more harm than good, whether I trusted my ability when in the moment. I still wanted to help, but I didn't want to do harm. In reality I didn't trust myself enough with handling the person, but did what I could manage in the surrounding area.</p>
        <p>I look back and think it was the right decision given what was happening. He was being handled, I wasn't confident and in the end I did what I could. I think it's a shame that despite completing the first aid course I still didn't feel competent in the situation.</p>

        <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>I think I'm a funny mix of sociable and introverted. I grew up with a strong interest in video games and team sports but not so much clubbing or parties. Mostly house parties where you drink with people you know well. I think it indicates I'm comfortable being on my own and in social collaborative environments. Not so much at larger parties but after a drink or two I'm firing on all cylinders. </p>
        <p>Some lessons I learnt from those around me:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I often look to my brothers who are good at tinkering, iterating and figuring things out. They rarely make the same mistake twice and show me that risks are necessary.</li>
          <li>My sisters taught me that forgiveness is important so you can move on without weighing yourself down. Letting go makes the present and future easier.</li>
          <li>My mum taught me that no matter what happens in life, it will be okay. </li>
          <li>My cousin is very experimental and comfortable. If I have a difficult decision to make I think on what he'd think or reach out to him to talk things through.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I'm a reflective person and have spent a lot of time looking back so I can understand myself as I move forward. Reflecting on my personal challenges has allowed me to gain perspective on how someone else may see things and have more patience with and understanding for people. </li>
          <li>During my school years I played many team sports and developed a strong sense of conscientiousness and duty for my team. This translates into the workplace where I enjoy being a team player and rising to the occasion when needed. </li>
          <li>I'm a deliberate decision maker. I'm often not the fastest at making challenging decisions but I will have good reasons for the decisions I make. I do well at researching solutions and obtaining knowledge to inform those decisions.</li>
          <li>I'm a good problem solver. I'm able to look at a problem and use or acquire knowledge to identify some approaches, pick which one seems most appropriate and implement it.</li>
          <li>These strengths will support me by being able to work closely with the people around me. I'll be able to hear what they do and make good decisions for myself and share what I think is helpful knowledge to the group. I'll make a support group with my peers where we can share where each other are stuck and support each other with shared knowledge learning from collective experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
        <p>I can lose confidence and feel like I'm not good enough. This can result in me procrastinating and getting easily distracted when I'm doing something out of my comfort zone. This sometimes results in me getting stressed until I break it down or talk with someone. </p>
        <p>I care about social approval so sometimes I can become reserved, quiet or avoiding conflict when something I have to say may disagrees, clashes or creates friction with someone. I'd like to improve how I handle those types of interactions.</p>
        <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p>I was working on a group project where roles were chosen and I was responsible for research and writing the analysis report. A group member was wanting to rewrite it as they thought it wasn't adequate. I was open to feedback but the changes they were recommending were excessive and beyond the scope of the material. I was honest and politely reminded them of the roles and that I was responsible for the report. I believed it was outside the scope and would challenge the page limit. They had forgotten about the roles and apologised. </p>
        <p>I think I was a bit too firm and could've found a more tactful way to handle it, but we didn't have any issues after that and the project went smoothly from there.</p>

        <h2>Identity</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I recently changed the boot door on a car and hadn't done anything like it before. I enjoyed the discovery of problems and figuring out what to do as I went, learning what was needed as I went and ending up with a better result than I started. It gave me confidence to do similar projects and look after my own vehicle more.</li>
