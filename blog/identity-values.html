      <h1>Identity</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>I recently changed the boot door on a car and hadn't done anything like it before. I enjoyed the discovery of problems and figuring out what to do as I went, learning what was needed as I went and ending up with a better result than I started. It gave me confidence to do similar projects and look after my own vehicle more.</li>
        <li>I'm a reflective person and have spent a lot of time looking back so I can understand myself as I move forward. Reflecting on my personal challenges has allowed me to gain perspective on how someone else may see things and have more patience and understanding for people.</li>
        <li>I'm a deliberate decision maker. I'm often not the fastest at making challenging decisions but I will have good reasons for the decisions I make. I do well at researching solutions and obtaining knowledge to inform those decisions.</li>
        <li>During my school years I played many team sports and developed a strong sense of conscientiousness and duty for my team. This translates into the workplace where I enjoy being a team player and rising to the occasion when needed. </li>
