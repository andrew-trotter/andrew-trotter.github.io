        <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>     
        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>My heart has always been driven towards helping people. I've considered many paths like Physiotherapy, Psychotherapy or a military organisation. I've also always had a head for technology. I've enjoyed my fair share of video games, built computers, operated digital printers and helped friends and family with technology qualms and queries. I used to write blog posts as a young man finding his way in the world and the internet has always been a place I come to for help or guidance.</p>
        <p> My long term goal is to be in the tech industry and use that to help people. I will begin as a web developer as we will always need an interface to the internet, but will keep my eyes open to what draws me. It's ambiguous and doesn't have a destination and that's awesome, because technology is always changing and so can I.</p>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>My views on my strengths and weaknesses haven't changed. I have an improved understanding of them and I will continue to improve that understanding into bootcamp. I will, for example, still have a desire to get unstuck myself, but I'll be better at involving people earlier on so the project can move more smoothly. I will be curious and go down rabbit holes, but I'll be more mindful of time commitments and whether I can afford that rabbit hole or not.</p>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
        <p> I feel pretty good overall for non-technical issues. I have some concern for the workload as I live a bit far from campus, but I have support at home and I am capable. I will be living nearby house-sitting my brother's place which will be helpful. So I still feel overall good about this too.</p>
        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>Being quite socially aware, I care about what my peers think of me and not wanting to disappoint them. This tends to make me conflict-avoidant so this is something I'd really appreciate improving this aspect of communciation at bootcamp if given the opportunity. This would tie into giving or receiving feedback and handling disagreements.</p>
        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <p>My experience from the support from the Foundations team has been amazing so far. A great breadth of technical and non-technical knowledge and support. I only hope that this continues with the bootcamp team.</p>
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>I expect myself to ask for help if I find myself stuck with both technical and non-technical problems. I understand asking for help is a general challenge for me, but I trust those I work with at bootcamp, peers and the team, are willing to support each other as I would be willing to support them too. I understand that this is a place of growth and to grow I must share that which needs to grow.</p>

        <h3> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
        My long term goal is use technology to create or assist in creating cool tools or experiences for people that help them.  That could be through creating it myself or in a team, managing and developing a team, or teaching people to build tools. I'll start with learning web development to enter the industry, then navigate towards what draws my attention. Long term I could move into other sectors like DevOps or Security.

        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>
        <ul><strong>Strengths:</strong>
          <li>I can be very focussed</li>
          <li>I enjoy helping others</li>
          <li>I enjoy exploring</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><strong>Limitations:</strong>
          <li>I can get bored and find it difficult to focus</li>
          <li>If I'm stuck I can find it difficult to find a balance between asking for help and trying to figure it out myself</li>
          <li>I can be disorganised or unstructured in my learning. Especially if I go down a rabbit hole or get hung up on something unimportant.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3> <br>
        Receiving feedback (positive or negative) and navigating conflicts. I am very conscientious and care a lot what people think of me or my work. Because of this, I tend to avoid (what I consider) potential conflicts.
        Organising my time more effectively.</p>            
        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
          <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
        </ul>
        <p> I commit to behaving in a professional manner and will aim to not derail the productivity of my peers. I will treat others with respect, patience and kindness. I will promote a cooperative and encouraging learning environment to work will with others.
        To manage my workload I will use commit the time necessary and use time-blocks as a guideline. 
        If I find the workload is getting too much, and help from peers isn't adequate, I will contact a facilitator to help me make a plan for how to prioritise and manage it more effectively. I will be open to this being a logistical/organisational or personal/emotional resolution.</p>
                  
        <h3> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </h3>
        <p>If I find myself getting distracted or too focussed on something, I will try to make a note of it for later reading. I will participate fully throughout the course and share if I have questions, answers or concerns. I will support others as best I can.</p>
      
        <h3> A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team: </h3>
        <p> I expect the facilitation team to be professional, respectful, kind and reasonable. I expect them to foster an encouraging and supportive learning environment.</p>
        <p>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</p>
