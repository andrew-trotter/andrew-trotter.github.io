        <strong> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong> <br>
        My long term goal is use technology to create or assist in creating cool tools or experiences for people that help them.  That could be through creating it myself or in a team, managing and developing a team, or teaching people to build tools. I'll start with learning web development to enter the industry, then navigate towards what draws my attention. Long term I could move into other sectors like DevOps or Security.

        <strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</strong>
              <ul><strong>Strengths:</strong>
                <li>I can be very focussed</li>
                <li>I enjoy helping others</li>
                <li>I enjoy exploring</li>
              </ul>
              <ul><strong>Limitations:</strong>
                <li>I can get bored and find it difficult to focus</li>
                <li>If I'm stuck I can find it difficult to find a balance between asking for help and trying to figure it out myself</li>
                <li>I can be disorganised or unstructured in my learning. Especially if I go down a rabbit hole or get hung up on something unimportant.</li>
              
              <p><strong> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong> <br>
              Receiving feedback (positive or negative) and navigating conflicts. I am very conscientious and care a lot what people think of me or my work. Because of this, I tend to avoid (what I consider) potential conflicts.
              Organising my time more effectively.</p>
            
            
              <strong> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
                <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
              </ul>
              <p> I commit to behaving in a professional manner and will aim to not derail the productivity of my peers. I will treat others with respect, patience and kindness. I will promote a cooperative and encouraging learning environment to work will with others.
              To manage my workload I will use commit the time necessaryand use timeblocks as a guideline. 
              If I find the workload is getting too much, and help from peers isn't adequate, I will contact a facilitator to help me make a plan for how to prioritise and manage it more effectively. I will be open to this being a logistical/organisational or personal/emotional resolution.</p>
                        
             <strong> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </strong>
             <p>If I find myself getting distracted or too focussed on something, I will try to make a note of it for later reading. I will participate fully throughout the course and share if I have questions, answers or concerns. I will support others as best I can.</p>
            
             <strong> A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team: </strong>
              <p> I expect the facilitation team to be professional, respectful, kind and reasonable. I expect them to foster an encouraging and supportive learning environment.</p>
            <strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</strong>
