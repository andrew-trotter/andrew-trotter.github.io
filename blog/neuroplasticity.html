        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
        <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity is important because of its implications.  Having awareness of the fact that the brain is not as static as a blueprint, but can adapt and change like a map is encouraging to those that, for example, have the self-limiting belief that they aren't good at math and therefore won't be good at programming. It allows from improvements in self-esteem and mental wellbeing and it raises the potential of individuals. For anyone who has experienced a brain injury, understanding neuroplasticity can be especially helpful as it can help with developing the neural pathways that may have been lost due to injury or illness.</p>
        <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
        <p>By knowing that my brain is not limited and able to become more adept at challenges that it encounters, I'm able to act as though I will eventually understand or improve at that which is difficult. 
          I find that when I remind myself, it helps me face challenges with more confidence and comfort. So long as I practice mindfulness and have the forgiveness to know that while I'm struggling in the moment, I'll understand or overcome the challenge with time and persistence.</p>
          <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
          <ul>Some ways to improve neuroplasticity include:
            <li>A good sleep schedule: If the brain isn't able to rest properly, it's not able to reset and consolidate all that was learned, and being unrested means you won't be operating 100%</li>
            <li>Regular exercise: Keeping your body healthy and energised impacts the brain positively too.</li>
            <li>Doing challenging things: Challenging your brain works similarly to a workout at the gym. It gets stronger with adversity, and often challenges are new things, which is exciting.</li>
            <li>Mindfulness Meditation: Practicing mindfulness meditation can help improve emotional regulation and attention. This in turn promotes better practices when dealing with challenge and new experiences.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
          <p>Growth Mindset promotes a perspective that orients personal growth towards challenges and obstacles, making them desirable and necessary rather than something to avoid. 
            It is relevant to neuroplasticity because they synergise on the idea that because the brain is malleable and it's able to evolve with adversity. If one believes that they can learn and grow, they're more equipped to deal with something challenging and learn from it.</p>
          <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
          <p>When I was exposed to it, it was liberating to know that I could truly grow and develop even after high school when I didn't believe I could change. I had a difficult time in high school and didn't achieve as high as I believed I should have. So because I hadn't truly challenged myself, my critical voice would undermine me when I approached something difficult. So knowing that I can re-examine that programming means that I'm not indentured to that belief.</p>
