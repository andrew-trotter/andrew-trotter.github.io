        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>I learnt that I'm very eager to help others when I understand something that can help someone</li>
          <li>I'm very driven to be knowledgeable and to try and smooth over weaknesses or gaps in knowledge. To know a lot, or know enough to not feel "caught out".</li>
          <li>That actually I can pick up new skills and learn on my own accord, rather than regurgitate spoon-fed material.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>The roles of values, empathy and self-awareness play a key role in determining what is important to my learning and development: <ul>
          <li>My values indicate what is important to me and are what I will relate my learning to.</li>
          <li>Empathy is for tempering times of struggle, celebrating moments of achievement and understanding those that I will be with.</li>
          <li>Self-awareness is for understanding myself, monitoring my emotions and how my actions affect others, and for integrity. That what I do and what I say is consistent.</li>
        </ul>  </p></section>

        <h3>What has surprised me most about core learning</h3>
        <p>Just how reassuring it is for roadblocks and obstacles to be overcome. Neuroplasticity and growth mindset reorienting struggle or difficulty as a pursuit for growth instead of just struggle. That there's something on the other side of struggle that's worth pursuing makes it seem much more worthwhile.</p>

        <section class="blog-box">
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>Probably that you do have to expose yourself to really be understood. The vulnerability of showing someone or some people that you're lacking in something and you'd like them to help is a bit scary. I know that it doesn't have to be just scary, that you can connect with people or inspire others by showing some courage.</p>

        <section class="blog-box">
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>The goal for Dev Academy is to "produce" hireable web developers. People on paper often look like good candidates, but fail at a personable level because they're unpleasant to work with. That could be for many reasons like they're not a good team player or they don't fulfill their promises etc. So it's important for the person that has these technical skills to be a solid person too.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="blog-box">
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>No, it doesn't feel like a waste. It's helped me understand that fulfilling a technical role is more than the technical role. The role is not in a vacuum, but in a workspace that has other people. There is work, and it is in a space with other people who work. To really work well with others, it's important to be able to look at yourself, look after yourself and beyond yourself towards others.</p>
