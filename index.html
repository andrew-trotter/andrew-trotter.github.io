      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>Hey everybody! I'm Andrew (he/him). I've lived around, being born in Wellington, grew up in Hawkes Bay and now living in Browns Bay in Auckland for 5 years. My grandma always told me that "patience is a virtue". Usually because I really wanted some of her baking right now, but applies to (arguably) more important things too. I believe if everyone was a bit more patient and open with a willingness to explore we'd understand each other more. I think it's important to understand each other to better work together to create quality things. </p>
      <p>I'm attending Dev Academy because I love the digital technology space. I believe tech is a great tool that we're currently still monkeying around with and I want to do some cool things with it that help people. Dev Academy will help me get some good skills to enter the industry rapidly and with guidance. Looking forward to meeting new people, working hard and through with you</p>
